				Kohli started dating Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma in 2013; the couple soon earned the portmanteau "Virushka".[427][428] Their relationship attracted substantial media attention, with persistent rumours and speculations in the media, as neither of the two publicly talked about it.[429] The couple married on 11 December 2017 in a private ceremony in Florence, Italy.[430][431] On 11 January 2021, their first child, a girl, was born.[432]

In 2018, Kohli revealed that he completely stopped consuming meat to cut down his uric acid levels which caused him a cervical spine issue and started affecting his finger and, in turn, his batting.[433][434][435] In 2021, he clarified that he is a vegetarian and not a vegan.[436]

Kohli has admitted that he is superstitious. He used to wear black wristbands as a cricket superstition; earlier, he used to wear the same pair of gloves with which he had "been scoring". Apart from a religious black thread, he has also been wearing a kara on his right arm since 2012.[437]

Kohli has a lot of tattoos on his body, he has tattoos of God Shiva in dhyan mudra on Kailash parvat because he worships Lord Shiva, Om, his parents names (Prem and Saroj), an Aadivasi sign, a monastery, Samurai warrior, the word 'Scorpion', and his ODI and Test cap numbers on his body.[438][439]
